Group Expectations Document
===

All Team Members are Expected to:

## Communication

- respond on slack within 24 hrs
- talk to team manager about any problems such as:
    - no progress on a task after a full day of focused work
    - interpersonal issues, with discretion, after trying and failing to resolve them
    - co-working issues, with discretion, immediately when noticed or when they are interfering with the ability to work effectively as a team 
- participate in group discussions
- add items to meeting agendas as appropriate
- read meeting agenda before each meeting and come prepared to meetings 
- address conflicts before they escalate
- inform the team manager ASAP if you suspect you will not meet a deadline

## Attendance

- attend all scheduled meetings
    - which will be primarily face to face
    - on time (or within 10 minutes of scheduled meeting start time if only on occasion)
    - or if unable to attend, will give a minimum of 24 hours notice of absence
    - if a remote meeting is more suitable due to inclimate weather or another reason, it should be proposed and +1'd on slack

## Deadlines

- treat deadlines set by Bockus with the same level of urgency as deadlines set by team members/manager
- set 'review deadlines' for large tasks

## Quality

- contribute to the best of their ability
- contribute clean code with appropriate commenting and variable names
    - other coding conventions for the project will be defined later

## Task Management

- log tasks as a scrum entry in hackmd each Wednesday and Friday by 11:59pm
    - each entry can include tasks worked on or completed on any or all days from the previous entry
- notify the group eary and often about progress on tasks


Failure to Meet Expectations
===

If a team member fails to meet the expectations defined above the following actions will be taken:

1. Team Manager will talk to the offending team member about the issue and review these guidelines to ensure there is understanding about the expectation that was not met and look for ways the team member can make up for the expectation they failed to meet.

2. A face to face group meeting will be called to discuss repeated failures to meet expectations so the group can determine whether or not expectations need to be revised and/or outline ways that a group member can regain the trust of the group. A resolution to be adopted is the expected outcome of this meeting.

3. Still continuing failures to meet expectations will be taken to Bockus with all records of attempts to handle the situation internally.
