## Notable notables

Notable names and numbers:

- student names were inspired by real names of notable contributors to
  the field of computer science

- names with hyphens, non-english characters and middle names were used to
  thoroughly test the limits of the system

- some names and student numbers differ slightly between what is listed on the file header and the student comments to account for common student behaviour 

Notable files:

- xmastree and christmasTree should be identified as completely plagiarized, with
changed variables and class names (2018-2019 Richard and Ada, 2015-2016 Noam)
